Minutes of Project : 
learned everthing and understood solidity smart contract and other components tailwind css and other like how to deploy like we used web3 so that out task like deploy and all this is easier .We used metamask for the wallet and eth as currency and other things but still the navbar is not completed just the logo is the there the link is not attached to that and tried to do that photos  and icons goes to that video.
first i started with  thirdweb sudo apt install npm -> npx thirdweb@latest create --contract setup the environment then developed smartcontract containing campaigns which is array of campaign which has address of owner ,title ,description ,target,deadline,amountcollected,image donators,donations,four functions createcampaign ,donate campaign getdonators and getcampaigns  once wrote all the functions and made the account in metamask and got some goerli from the link metioned in the video and in  .env wrote the private key then run npm run deploy and here is our project running and  we got the link then to deploy in thirdweb go to the thrdweb website and askd for deployment which will cost some goeli .
Now Comes for the frontedn npx thirdweb create --app then our basic layout is ready and all the details is shown intermial and wrote all the react the code and made the frontend which is just added the navnar sidebar a search bar  and showing all campaigns and all those 
stuff in a campaign will get all the details related to the function and what we have in smart contract .
Thank you .
